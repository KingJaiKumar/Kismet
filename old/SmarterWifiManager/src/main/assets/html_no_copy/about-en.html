<p/><b><u>When in doubt, be smart</u></b>

<p/>Smarter Wi-Fi Manager aims to be smart - in general, it should be invisible and will manage your
Wi-Fi state in the background.

<p/><b><u>Using Auto-Learning</u></b>

<p/>Smarter Wi-Fi Manager automatically learns where you use Wi-Fi by learning what cell towers are
nearby.

<p/>When you go to a new location for the first time, simply turn on Wi-Fi manually.  As long as
you're successfully connected to a network, Smarter Wi-Fi Manager will learn what towers are nearby.

<p/>When you leave the range of a Wi-Fi network, Smarter Wi-Fi Manager will automatically turn off
the Wi-Fi radio.

<p/>When you return to a location previous learned, Wi-Fi will be enabled automatically.

<p/><b><u>Learned Network Maintenance</u></b>
<p/>Over time, the number of locations attached to a Wi-Fi network can grow out of control.  Enabling the
&quot;Location Maintenance&quot; preference will keep the list of learned locations smaller, without disrupting
performance.

<p/>Tower maintenance occurs at regular intervals, <i>but only when you are connected to Wi-Fi</i>.  In other
words, Smarter Wi-Fi Manager will only remove locations from a Wi-Fi network <i>when you are able to immediately learn new locations</i>,
which helps minimize any unexpected behavior.

<p/><b><u>Ignoring Networks</u></b>

<p/>Some networks - like those run by cable companies, or default access point names like 'linksys' -
appear all over.  These networks can confuse the auto-learning system and cause it to leave Wi-Fi
turned on far more often than might be desired.

<p/>Adding a network to the ignored list turns off auto-learning while connected to that network name.
Learning will be automatically re-enabled once you leave that network, either by disconnecting or by
changing to another network.

<p/><b><u>Bluetooth Blacklisting</u></b>

<p/>Smarter Wi-Fi Manager can turn off Wi-Fi when connected to specified Bluetooth devices.

<p/>For example, it may be desirable to turn off Wi-Fi networking whenever you are connected to
your car stereo.  While connected to the blacklisted device, Wi-Fi will stay off and learning will be
disabled.

<p/><b><u>Open Source</u></b>
